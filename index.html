        <summary>My goals:</summary>
        <p>
          I would be lying if I said I didn't care about the money, however I want to do a job that makes me happy. Ever since I was a kid programming and computer hardware have always been a hobby of mine. I want to work for a successful company, making a product I am proud of (hopefully websites after this course, designing a website or app) that offers me the freedoms to live comfortably with things like flexable hours, good pay rates, and an environment that is fun to work in.
